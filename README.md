React Country-Based Phone Number Input
Overview
This React application provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface for users to enter their phone numbers. It automatically detects the user's country based on their IP address and pre-populates the appropriate country dialing code.

Additionally, a modal interface is available for users who wish to manually select a different country.
